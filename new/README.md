#	Constants:

Constants are the physical limits of the system.

##	System Maximum Effective Speed
	
Effective speed is the combination of maximum speed, acceleration and travel distance for a given axis. System Maximum Effective Speed is the fastest effective speed the whole system can move. 

## 	Acceleration

Acceleration is responsible for bringing an axis to its full speed fast, but also for keeping the distance of the acceleration slope short.

## 	Slope

The length of the acceleration and deceleration slope will be refered to as slope.

The slower the acceleration, the bigger the slope. The bigger the slope, the smaller the potential travel distance. The smaller the travel distance, the smaller the working area. 

Working area is the area determined by the axis which is not the printing axis (X or Y) and the travel distance comprised between both slopes (acceleration and deceleration slope).

Printing should occur only within the slopes.

The higher the speed, the bigger the slope. If the slope is too big, the maximum speed might not be reached before the second slope. There is a point in which maximum speed doesn't matter if it cannot be reached.
